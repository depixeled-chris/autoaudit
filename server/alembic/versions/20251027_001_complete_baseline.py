Create Date: 2025-10-27

This migration consolidates ALL migrations 001-017 from the old system into
a single Alembic baseline. It marks itself as applied without changes if
tables already exist.

Includes:
- compliance_checks with llm_input_text column
- llm_calls table
- page_types table (18 types)
- states and legislation system (sources, digests)
- preamble management system (comprehensive)
- rules system with lineage tracking
- rule_collisions table
- llm_logs table with full cost tracking
- llm_model_config table
