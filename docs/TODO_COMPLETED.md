**Result**: Mental model established, ready for implementation

### Fix Database Schema Gaps
**Completed**: 2025-10-27

  - `legislation_digest_id INTEGER`
  - `is_manually_modified BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0`
  - `original_rule_text TEXT`
  - `status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'`
  - `supersedes_rule_id INTEGER`
- ✅ Created `rule_collisions` table with indexes
- ✅ Created `llm_logs` table with 7 indexes
- ✅ Populated lineage data for existing rules
- ✅ Updated MIGRATION_SYSTEM.md with new workflow
- ✅ Updated DATABASE_SCHEMA.md with new tables

**Files Changed**:
